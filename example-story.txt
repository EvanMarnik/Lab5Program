Dear Jim,
Are you sick and tired of looking down to see your favorite blue pants ruined by a pesky pizza stain... FOREVER!?!?
Have you been singing yourself to sleep every night because the only pants you own smell like burnt rubber? Wll you no longer have to gret about keeping your pants pretty because Tide pens can take care of even the most boring fabric disasters. Want to partake in the annual meatball fight in Italy? Have at it! Tide pens will help clean up the aftermath. Theyre so easy even your dog could do it! Simply toss one in the laundry, and boom instant clean! For only $25 you can purchase a pack of 25 Tide pens so dont worry about eating for the next 25 days.
So if you want to be the next Indiana Jones go have an adventure because we got your foot.
If its got to be gross, its got to be Tide!
